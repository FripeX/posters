## Information
This is a "poster" system originally designed to allow users to create their own posters and display them on any vertically flat surface. While there are other similar systems available, this version is free and only requires a single dependency (ox_lib). It includes QBCore code with ox_inventory items.

I, FripeX, have adapted and converted this system to work with ESX, broadening its usability. Feel free to fork and modify it for your own framework/inventory needsâ€”I have included the necessary adaptations for ESX users who might find it beneficial.

No need to input any image size data; it's automatically captured from the image URL. The DUI is created based on the actual size of the images, making this system perfect for "graffiti" tagging, advertising your player-owned business, etc.

## Dependencies
- ox_lib
- QBCore (original)
- ox_inventory (original)
- ESX (added by FripeX)

As stated above, feel free to rework this how you would like with your own systems. The ESX version is now available thanks to my adaptation.

## Acknowledgements
A big thanks to the original developers and the FiveM community for their continuous inspiration and support. This ESX adaptation aims to extend the utility and accessibility of the original system.
